# Kaggle Plant Seed identification challenge
Only image resigining and basic traning without any tweaks. Score and model can be improved a lot. Notebooks are very raw and I didn't spend time to structure the code or commenting.
I have made these notebooks with the material taught till lecture 3 in fastaiv3 course.
